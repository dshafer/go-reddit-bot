What does the bot do?
----------------------

Right now, it takes posts from a number of subreddits (eg /r/yesyesyesnoyes) and cross-posts them to `/r/maybemaybemaybe <http://reddit.com/r/maybemaybemaybe>`_  However, only ``main.go`` is specific to this purpose.  Everything under ``/client`` is generic, and could be used to make other bots (though it is incredibly limited at the moment).
